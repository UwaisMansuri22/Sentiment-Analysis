In today's data-driven world, sentiment analysis plays a vital role across industries, helping businesses gain actionable insights from textual data. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** takes this one step further by categorizing data by aspect and identifying the sentiment associated with each one. This project focuses on leveraging ABSA to analyze product reviews, empowering businesses to make better decisions and enhance customer experiences.

## **Overview**

This project showcases a robust **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Model** developed during my tenure as a Data Science Intern at **Kmart**. Using product reviews, this model efficiently identifies sentiments related to specific aspects of products or services, enabling data-driven decision-making and improving customer satisfaction.

The model combines the power of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to automate sentiment classification, reducing the need for manual analysis while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. The system is ideal for:
- Analyzing customer feedback
- Identifying areas for improvement in products or services
- Enhancing the customer experience

## **Features**

- **Aspect Identification:** Extracts specific aspects (e.g., "quality," "price," "delivery") from product reviews.
- **Sentiment Classification:** Determines whether the sentiment for each aspect is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Efficient and Scalable:** Automates the process of analyzing large datasets, saving time and reducing costs.
- **Visualization:** Provides clear visualizations of sentiment distributions for better interpretability.
